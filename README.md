I participated as the 1st year researcher on the project named “Intelligent Original Soundtrack Matching Program Development based on Video Configuration Parameter”. 

The aim of the project is to make program that can recommend soundtrack by analyzing video. These days, lots of youtubers are making their own videos. To find right music for the video, they need listen to every music that might fit. So it aims to be able to recommend the right music just by uploading a video. 

My role in this project is to make a program that can extract data we need by analyzing videos. I choose five important features of the extracted video data, and there are ‘topic’, ‘sentiment and emotion’, ‘velocity of pixel movements’, ‘color’ and ‘distribution of age and gender’. 

I extracted ‘topic’ and ‘sentiment and emotion’ data by Microsoft azure video indexer. ‘velocity of pixel movements’ data is extracted by optical flow and ‘color’ is by image histogram. Lastly, ‘distribution of age and gender’ is extracted by CNN. With the results of video data analysis, I wrote and contributed my paper, “Convergence Analysis Algorithm Study for Extracting Image Configuration Parameters” to The Korean Society of Science and Art.
